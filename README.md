# Hourly taxi ride prediction
Solution Overview for Hourly Taxi Ride Prediction in a Kaggle Competition
Problem Statement
The goal is to accurately predict the number of taxi rides in a city on an hourly basis. This requires understanding patterns from historical data, accounting for variables such as time of day, weather, and special events which can influence ride frequency.

**Data Preprocessing**

*Time Series Decomposition*: Break down the historical taxi ride data into systematic and random components (trend, seasonality, and noise).
*Feature Engineering*: Create time-based features (hour of the day, day of the week, etc.), weather-related features (temperature, precipitation), and event-based features (holidays, major events).
*Normalization*: Apply normalization techniques to scale the features, aiding in model performance and convergence speed.

**Model Selection and Training**

*Model Choice*: Employ a combination of models to handle different aspects of the time series data. Use ARIMA or SARIMA for capturing trends and seasonal effects, and Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Machines for integrating external factors like weather and events.
*Parameter Tuning*: Use cross-validation and grid search techniques to fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.
*Ensemble Techniques*: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness, using methods like weighted averaging or stacking.

**Evaluation**

*Backtesting*: Simulate model performance on historical data to gauge effectiveness before making future predictions.
*Performance Metrics*: Evaluate using metrics suitable for regression tasks, such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error), to measure prediction accuracy against actual values.
Challenges and Insights
*Data Sparsity*: Address gaps or anomalies in ride data (e.g., during extreme weather events) which can distort model training.
*Adaptability*: Ensure models can adapt to new trends or sudden changes in ride patterns, possibly by retraining models periodically with recent data.
*Computational Complexity*: Manage the trade-off between model complexity and computational feasibility, especially when processing large datasets or deploying models in real-time scenarios.

**Tools and Libraries Used**

~Python~: Primary programming language due to its rich ecosystem of data science libraries.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Statsmodels: For ARIMA/SARIMA implementations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and cross-validation.
XGBoost: For implementing Gradient Boosting Machines.
By following this structured approach, the solution aims to provide accurate, robust predictions of hourly taxi ride demands, leveraging a comprehensive set of tools and methodologies to tackle the complex nature of time series forecasting.
